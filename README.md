Examples of image synthesis from any-level semantic layouts. (a) The coarsest layout, i.e. at the 0-th precision level, is equivalent to a text input; (d) the finest layout, i.e. at the highest level, is close to an accurate segmentation map; (a)-(d) intermediate level layouts (from coarse to fine), the shape control becomes tighter with increasing levels. (e) We can specify different precision levels for different components, e.g. to include a 0-th level style indicator while the remaining regions are of higher levels.
